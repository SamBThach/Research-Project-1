			<h3> The following is a consent form for a web-based matching game to research prospective students' understanding of computing programs.</h3>
			<p> The goals of this research are to help students understand the differences among computing programs at Oregon Tech and to help Oregon Tech understand how students perceive computing related programs.
			<p> The expected duration is 10 minutes, and the data collection for this study will run for 15 months until September 2022.
			<p> The web-based matching game consists of six images that will be matched to six phrases.
			<p> There are minimal risks to participants such as eye-strain from monitor use. Breaks are allowed.
			<p> Participation is voluntary. The web-matching game will not affect admission chances.
			<p> You may learn more about the difference among the computing majors at Oregon Tech.
			<p> You can also learn more about the majors by perusing the Oregon Tech website at: <a href= http://oit.edu> http://oit.edu</a>
			<p> The answers that participants submit will be collected and stored in a database and used for research.
				Data stored will be held anonymously and will not hold any personally identifiable data that can be traced back to participants.
				This is an anonymous study. Personally identifiable information will not be collected, so your name, ip address, location, or other identifying information will not be collected or stored.
